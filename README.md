# **BUGZ - Gotta Find Them All! 🐞**

## **Project Idea**

The idea of this project is to test the demo e-commerce website Automation
Exercise.
Automation Exercise provides a wide range of real-world e-commerce features
such as user authentication, product browsing, cart management, checkout, and
account handling. These make it an ideal platform for practicing manual testing,
test automation, and API validation.
